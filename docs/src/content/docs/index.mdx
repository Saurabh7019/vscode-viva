This extension would not exist without the incredible work of the [Microsoft 365 & Power Platform Community](https://pnp.github.io/). The sample gallery is built entirely on community-contributed solutions and many features like upgrading, validating, and deploying SPFx projects are powered by the [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/) tool. 

A huge thank you to all our amazing contributors! Creating this extension would not have been possible if it weren't for the enormous work done by you. You all rock ü§©.

If you would like to participate, the community welcomes everybody who wants to build and share feedback around Microsoft 365 & Power Platform. Join one of our [community calls](https://pnp.github.io/#community) to get started and be sure to visit üëâ https://aka.ms/community/home.
